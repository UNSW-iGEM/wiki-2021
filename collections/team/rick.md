Rick is in his final year of a Bachelor of Science majoring in Microbiology and Pathology. Rick was interested in joining iGEM as it presented an opportunity to apply learnt theory to a practical application, paired with a more open ended and practical approach to an issue of national significance. With present circumstances, his focus has shifted more to research and experimental design, and examining how the benefits of synthetic biology can be presented to the wider public. In his downtime, he enjoys bushwalking around Sydney, cycling with friends, training in kendo, and spending excessive amounts of time in front of a computer to satiate an amateur interest in history and geopolitics.
