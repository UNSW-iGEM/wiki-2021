Vivian is in her third year of a Bachelor of Advanced Science, majoring in Biotechnology and Molecular Cell Biology. During her time in iGEM, she has gained more knowledge about how to apply synthetic biology to real-world problems and make science more accessible to the broader community. She particularly enjoyed putting her inner creativity to use through designing children's books, merchandise and puzzles for the scicom team. During her free time, Vivian likes to explore nature by going on long walks, listening to chill music, playing the piano, and doing crafty things.
