Ying Fei is a third-year Bachelor of Medical Science student majoring in Molecular Cell Biology and Pharmacology. She is excited to have the opportunity to explore the possibilities of synthetic biology and applying scientific knowledge to solve real-world problems. Throughout her iGEM journey, she particularly enjoyed the time spent in the lab. Her involvement in iGEM opened up her perspective on the different aspects of science that are equally important as the scientific research itself. During her free time, she enjoys reading, listening to podcasts and going on walks in nature.
