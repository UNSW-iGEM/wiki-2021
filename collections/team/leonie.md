​​Leonie is in her fourth year of a double degree in Bioinformatics Engineering and Science (majoring in Statistics), and was excited to join an interdisciplinary team approaching synthetic biology from a variety of angles. She worked in the Dry Lab and Wiki teams, which was a great opportunity to apply her existing computing and bioinformatics knowledge, and challenge herself by delving into newer areas such as biochemistry. In her time away from her laptop, Leonie enjoys exploring nature and indulging herself in mediocre phone photography!
