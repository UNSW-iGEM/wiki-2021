Imogen is in her third year of a Bachelor of Science, majoring in Microbiology. Imogen was
excited to participate in her first taste of real science, outside of class and running a project with
a very cool group of people. The highlight of the project for her was time in the lab and getting to
know the ins and outs of all the project’s technical aspects. She definitely lived out her mad
scientist dreams, even if just for a bit. When she isn’t in the lab or studying, Imogen enjoys her
hobbies of sewing, drawing, painting and knitting (she tends to lose track of all her in-progress
projects).
