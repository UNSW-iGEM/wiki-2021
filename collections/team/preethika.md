Currently in the third year of her Bachelor of Science (Biotechnology) degree, Preethika was
eager to translate the knowledge she had amassed from University, to a project that focused on
ameliorating the conditions of our environment. During her time in the Human Practices team,
she was grateful to have been given the opportunity to be a storyteller - listening to the consortia
of voices who had been impacted by coral bleaching had allowed her to begin understanding
the complexities that make up Australia. In her spare time, you’ll see her cooking up a storm in
the kitchen and completing 1,000 piece jigsaw puzzles with her roommates!
