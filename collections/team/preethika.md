Currently in the third year of her Bachelor of Science (Biotechnology) degree, Preethika was
eager to translate the knowledge she had amassed from University, to a project that focused on
ameliorating the conditions of our environment. During her time in the Human Practices team,
she was grateful to have been given the opportunity to be a storyteller - listening to the consortia
of voices who had been impacted by coral bleaching had allowed her to begin understanding
the complexities that make up Australia. In her spare time, youâ€™ll see her cooking up a storm in
the kitchen and completing 1,000 piece jigsaw puzzles with her roommates!
