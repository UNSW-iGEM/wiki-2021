Naomi is finishing up her penultimate year of a degree in Bioinformatics Engineering (Honours),
and was keen as a bean to use the skills she’d learnt (and a bunch she had to discover) to solve
problems in synthetic biology! She loves doing puzzles, especially when the pieces are
macromolecules involved in physical- and bio-chemistry ... The project was a fantastic
opportunity to be part of a fun team of people doing real science. She particularly enjoyed
developing skills in structural and kinetic modelling, since both consider the energy of systems
and interactions, but in different ways to produce unique insights! She also had a ball learning
from “The Master of Web Dev” Leonie while coding up the wiki. When she isn’t coding away
behind a screen, you might find her performing at a Rhythmic Gymnastics competition, writing
fantasy novels or listening to theology podcasts.
