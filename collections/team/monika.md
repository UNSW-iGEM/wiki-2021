Monika is a third-year Advanced Science student majoring in Biotechnology. Monika joined the Wet Lab and Human Practices teams because she loves the idea of using synthetic biology to find solutions to help preserve the natural environment. During her involvement in the UNSW iGEM Team, she has developed a better appreciation for the Great Barrier Reef and the people dedicated to preserving it for future generations. Monika believes there is always something useful to learn in any situation and has been grateful to have gained so much knowledge and experience working alongside such a bright and motivated group of people.
