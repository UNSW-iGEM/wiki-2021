Konstantina is currently in her second year of a Bachelor of Medical Science. Her eagerness to apply the practical skills she has acquired throughout university stimulated her to participate in iGEM to offer multi-angled solutions to coral bleaching. She worked in the Dry Lab and Wet Lab teams which allowed her to gain new skills in structural and mathematical modelling, experience how research is conducted in the laboratory, and connect with colleagues and academics. When not in the lab or the library, Konstantina adores playing the violin, painting, dancing ballet and riding her bike with her friends.
