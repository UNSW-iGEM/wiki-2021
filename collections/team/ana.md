Ana is in her fourth year of a Bachelor of Advanced Science and Commerce, majoring in Pathology, Marketing and Information Systems (quite a handful haha). She was extremely interested in working on a sustainable solution to protect our reefs. The iGEM Human Practices team turned out to be the perfect opportunity to learn about diverse stakeholder perspectives, deepen her understanding of the interplay of social sciences and synthetic bio while collaborating with a fun team. Her passion for reef ecosystems stems from her love of ocean swimming, snorkelling and watching docos.
