Nikola is a second year Medical Science student, majoring in Medical Pharmacology. Nikola entered the iGEM competition and Dry Lab team because of his passion for biochemistry and furthering his understanding of novel, synthetic biological processes. Throughout this experience as part of this journey, he was able to have a deeper appreciation for the scientific processes involved in developing practical solutions to real world problems, an opportunity provided through the iGEM competition. Looking at different catalytic intermediates and models of sHSPs developed by our team was a prime highlight of his. The insight and contribution the Dry Lab team made toward one of Australiaâ€™s greatest national treasures - the Great Barrier Reef - is both a rewarding and satisfying thought. In his spare time, you may find Nikola going for a run, at the gym, playing indoor soccer with his friends or online playing FIFA.
