Ryan is a third year Medical Science student majoring in Medical Microbiology. Ryan joined the Wiki & Design team and Dry Lab team because of his passion for wanting to learn new hard skills. He also volunteered himself as Admin Co-Lead given his experiences in other team management and leadership positions. Throughout the duration of iGEM, Ryan has developed a greater awareness for the methodical yet creative process in designing solutions for real world issues. In this way, he has learnt a lot about the creative journey that underpins research based careers and is excited for the foreseeable future where conservation of the Great Barrier Reef is better appreciated. In his spare time you may find him catching up on some much needed sleep or bothering his dog who likes to laze around all day.
