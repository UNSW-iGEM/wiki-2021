Sarah is in her third year of a Bachelor of Advanced Science, majoring in Microbiology. She joined iGEM in hopes of learning about the real-world applications of synthetic biology and to gain lab experience. She is a member of the Wet Lab team and enjoyed the challenges inside and outside of the lab throughout the project. While not succumbing to her crippling Instagram addiction, Sarah spends her time curating Spotify playlists and occasionally goes hiking.
