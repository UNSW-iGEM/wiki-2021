Karina is a third year student in her degree of Bachelor of Advanced Science, with a major in
Ecology and a minor in Chemistry. Her participation in this yearâ€™s iGEM was in a strive to
participate in a synthetic biology conservation project, outside of her comfort zone in ecology.

She worked in the Science Communication subgroup to help spread the word, and help connect
parts of the community together to strive for a better environmental footstep. She supported her
team, and together they brought engagement with both the general public and the Indigenous
People to bring insights on the reality of climate change. Her love for science and conservation
all stemmed from her love of plants, which she is a parent to hundreds!
