Larae is in her final year of a Bachelor of Design (Honours). Larae was interested in joining iGEM as it presented an opportunity to apply her honours research on the intersection of science and design. She was also excited to apply her skills to improve a current world problem. During her experience with iGEM she particularly enjoyed developing scientific concepts and information into interactive graphics. She is a bit of a design nerd with her interest in interactive UX design! In her downtime, she enjoys anything active and adventurous such as bush walking, amusement parks and spending time with her doggo!
