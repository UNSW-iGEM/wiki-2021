    <p>Science communication is a part of science that enables effective communication from scientists to individuals of all ages. In many scientific fields, including synthetic biology, there are technical terms and concepts which are not easily comprehensible by the general public.  Consequently, we lose the participation, the collective power and the collaboration that comes from working with the public against major issues locally and globally. Therefore, we strive to make a change and work with the public, integrating their presence in our project and spread credible information to help us alleviate the complication at hand.
    </p>
        <!-- <br /><br /> -->
    <p>
        As the general public consists of different levels of age groups and background knowledge, our project consisted of a number of items in different mediums that focused on various groups. These included visual representation of our project’s importance, physical merchandise for younger audiences, games with educational background and stories to convey the concept of our project and synthetic biology. By using a variety of material, it allowed the content to be understandable, clear and interesting, without overloading them on the technicalities. Overall, individuals engaging with the project could interact with the material; gaining a broader perspective and knowledge on the issue at hand, and such, voluntarily engaged with our project.

    <h2>Educational Package</h2>

    <br />

    <p>
        This educational package was designed to be delivered as a whole package to families in our team’s local Sydney Aquarium. It includes a variety of different items each targeted at individuals of different age groups; young children (ages 0-9), young adults (ages 10-18), and adults (ages 18+). Our goal was to create a fun and relevant method to educate the public on what our topic was about, and basics on scientific concepts involving synthetic biology and ecology. These items were designed to be interacted with and physically distributed. 
    </p>
    
    <p>
        Due to the COVID-19 pandemic in our region, we could not distribute these packages as had been initially planned at the beginning of the year. Therefore this last-minute change has led us to  additionally strive to make an electronic version that enables individuals to access the material remotely.

    <h2>UNSW iGEM x ‘The SAMS Podcast’ Collaboration</h2>

        <div style="font-size: 0.9em; text-align: center;"><em>Listen: UNSW iGEM x 'The SAMS Podcast'</em></div>
    </div>
    <p>
        In the digital age where podcasts are experiencing rapid growth in popularity to deliver content in a casual yet informative manner, we believed that this format was an excellent way to help us engage and communicate our message to the broader community (1). This focus has become extremely important, as we were unable to hold in-person events due to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic unfolding in New South Wales.
    </p>

    <p>
        We collaborated with a student society, UNSW Students of Advanced Mathematics and Science (SAMS), on their fortnightly podcast called ‘The SAMS Podcast’ which have seen audiences of over 400+ across 16+ different countries and all ages. They commonly explore the educational, professional, and personal journeys of current science students throughout their degrees, inspiring students to learn new things about different fields of study and opportunities within science research through stories and advice shared.
    </p>

    <p>
        In a two-episode special with SAMS, we explored the overarching concepts of synthetic biology and introduced all aspects of our project, ‘Protecc Coral’ from an economic, educational, and social point-of-view before diving into our wet lab and dry lab work. The aim of these episodes was to provide greater awareness of synthetic biology and how it can be applied to real-world problems. Furthermore, a heavy focus was placed on providing exposure to our project and the issue of coral bleaching in the Great Barrier Reef. We also talked about our own personal journey throughout our time in iGEM, from things that we learnt, new profound perspectives and challenges along the way, allowing us to add a personal touch that is relatable.
    </p>

    <p>
        The style of this podcast is laid-back allowing for casual conservations to occur where we were able to share our own stories. The podcast is primarily targeted towards audiences aged 18+ and currently studying in university, however, the episodes are accessible to most audiences as we communicate complex scientific concepts in basic, lay terms. Due to the lockdown situation in NSW, we were unable to record in-person, so instead, episodes were recorded over Discord. These episodes were promoted through social media platforms through UNSW iGEM and UNSW SAMS and are now available to listen on Spotify and Soundcloud by searching ‘The SAMS Podcast’.

    <h2>Presenting to the Industry: Aurecon Life Below Water Month</h2>

    <br />
    
    <p>
        Aurecon is an engineering, design and advisory company aiming to bring ideas to life (1). Every week throughout August this year, Aurecon held events surrounding topics of the marine ecosystem in their ‘Life Below Water’ month. The event that our team participated in involved watching two 10-minute snippets of the ABC iView Documentary ‘Can We Save the Reef?’ with guest speakers between each session revolving around understanding and trying to resolve coral bleaching issues surrounding the Great Barrier Reef caused by climate change.
    </p>

    <p>
        The UNSW iGEM team was extremely grateful to participate as guest speakers at an industry event by Aurecon on the 19th of August through Microsoft Teams. We provided a 10-minute presentation of our iGEM project and what we believe the future holds for genetically modified coral to employees, as well as participated in a Q&A panel session, where the employees could gain further insight into our project, or ask any questions surrounding coral bleaching in general.
