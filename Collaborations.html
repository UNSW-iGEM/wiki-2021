        Team Protecc Coral has strived to collaborate with both the public and various stakeholders, as assisted by <a href="/Human_Practices">Human Practices</a>, and other scientists inside and beyond iGEM. This connection has helped us refine our process and brought to us a diverse perspective that we would have possibly missed without it.
    </p>

    <p>
        Collaboration has undeniably brought not only a different perspective to our project but have also resulted in great enjoyment as we met new individuals. However, due to the pandemic situation in our team’s region this year, our collaboration has been more restricted than we would have preferred.

    <h2>Biodiversity Symposium</h2>
    <br />

    <p>
        A public outreach to other iGEM groups and individuals interested in learning about the benefits of synthetic biology 
        in biodiversity was conducted through us hosting a biodiversity symposium. This event included the presentation by 
        five different iGEM groups including ourselves, Team iGEM Stony Brook, Team iGEM Groningen, Team iGEM University of Sydney, 
        Team iGEM NU Kazakhstan. These groups presented what their project included and their team’s motivation. 
        As our symposium’s key theme was biodiversity, each team had also detailed how biodiversity was important to their 
        project and the ecological impacts of their solution. Altogether, this event incited the appearance of around 50 
        different individuals, who came along to learn and ask questions that provoked thought into their projects. 
        Consequently, this symposium provided an opportunity, where international teams could engage in discussions forwarded 
        by audience questions.
    </p>
    <p>
        This symposium showed to our team a glimpse of the global effort to fight against issues tormenting the environment. This international collaboration was particularly uplifting, as we saw how every team is working to globally help conserve their environment.

        Through this event, different host iGEM groups gained more solidity to the development of their project through the question-and-answer sessions after each of their presentations. They were queried on how their experimentation (computational and laboratory) would proceed, and how it related to their real-world problems. For instance, with iGEM Kazakhstan, we explored the entrepreneurship of their project and how they connected with local businesses to alleviate the nitrogen crisis in their region.

                Microcystin is a toxin released by harmful cyanobacterial algal blooms. It impacts the environment negatively with evidence showing that it directly decreases zooplankton biodiversity, and thus, sequentially impact the environment. Their project is a proposed biodegradation solution, where they genetically modify <em>E. coli</em> to reduce the toxicity of microcystin.

                Oil spills are notorious for their damage on the environment, with overall pollution levels being the highest in their regions. This has resulted in threatened extinction of organisms critical to their ecosystem, including caspian seals, sturgeons, and turtles. Traditional methods of treating oil spills are expensive and often ineffective, as such their project’s goal is to increase the expression of rhamnolipids in <em>Pseudomonas putida</em> for soil and water purification.

                Ammonia pollution has been shown to result in contributing in the decline of global biodiversity. Their team’s region, Netherlands, is a contributor to ammonia pollution as the second-largest  global agricultural exporter. As such, their aim is to reduce ammonia production within livestock farms, one of the main source of ammonia emission. They have worked to do this through engineering yeast as a feed additive, providing a safe and cost-effective solution.
