                    I am a Jalanji, seaside woman and we have lots of stories about the reef. 
                    This painting story is about Mili, stinging jellyfish stirring out on the reef. 
                    We were taught at a young age to watch out, they sting and are very dangerous.

                    I recently went on a field trip to the reef with the Jabalbina Rangers.  
                    They help manage land and sea country around Wujal Wujal.  We saw dolphins, turtles and lots of fish. 
                    We did some fishing too. We were checking the health of the reef.  There is coral bleaching happening in some areas.  
                    We need to look after our country to make sure it’s here for our children, grandchildren and future generations.  
                    We have looked after our country for thousands of years. We know all the animals and plants.

                    I am from Jalanji Clan which means seaside. The Dulngku (reef) is big and beautiful and very important to our people. 
                    We are worried about what is happening to the Dulngku and the coral bleaching that is killing it.
