    <h2>Agarose Gel Preparation</h2>
    <br />
    <ol>
        <li>To prepare a 50mL agarose gel solution, first add 5g of agarose powder to an 100mL empty bottle before adding 50mL of 99% TAE buffer.</li>
        <li>Heat the solution in the microwave until it starts bubbling, take out and swirl until agarose powder dissolves and the solution turns clear. Repeat several times until the agarose powder has completely dissolved.</li>
        <li>Pour the agarose gel solution into a chamber with the comb set up and allow it to cool.</li>
        <li>Add 2μL of 6X dye to 10μL of DNA, mix it slightly before loading into wells.</li>

    <h2>BugBuster Protein Extraction</h2>
    <br />
    <ol>
        <li>Harvest cells from liquid culture by centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 10 min using a weighed centrifuge tube. For small scale extractions (1.5 ml or less), centrifugation can be performed in a 1.5-ml tube at 14,000–16,000 × g. Decant and allow the pellet to drain, removing as much liquid as possible. Determine the wet weight of the pellet.</li>
        <li>Resuspend the cell pellet in room temperature BugBuster Master Mix by pipetting or gentle vortexing, using 5 ml reagent per gram of wet cell paste. This typically corresponds to about 2.5 ml per 50-ml. culture. For small cultures use up to 1/5 culture volume for resuspension (e.g., use 300 µl BugBuster® Master Mix for 1.5 ml cultures). There are no adverse effects to using larger volumes of BugBuster Master Mix.</li>
        <li><b><em>Optional</em></b>: Add protease inhibitors. Protease inhibitors are compatible with BugBuster Master Mix.</li>
        <li>Incubate the cell suspension on a shaking platform or rotating mixer at a slow setting for 10–20 min at room temperature.<br />Note: The extract should not be viscous after incubation.</li>
        <li>Remove insoluble cell debris by centrifugation at 16,000 × g for 20 min at 4°C. If desired, save the pellet for inclusion body purification.</li>
        <li>Transfer the supernatant to a fresh tube. For SDS-PAGE analysis, remove a small sample (25–50 μl) and combine with equal volume of 4X SDS Sample Buffer (Cat. No. 70607-3). Immediately heat for 3 min at 85°C to denature proteins and then store at –20°C until SDS-PAGE analysis.</li>
