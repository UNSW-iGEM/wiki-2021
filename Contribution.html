    <h2>Registry Documentation</h2>

    <h4>Small Heat Shock Protein</h4>
    <br />
    <p>As part of our project to increase thermotolerance of the algal species <em>Symbiodinium goreaui</em>, we have conducted growth and survival assays on <em>E. coli</em> chassis expressing HSP22E (<b>existing Registry <a href="http://parts.igem.org/Part:BBa_K3558000" target="_blank">Part:BBa_K3558000</a></b>) where we <b>documented our experimental data on the experience page</b>. Due to limited laboratory access resulting from COVID-19 restrictions, both assays have only been performed once. The results were not what we expected but we have documented the possible reasons and have refined our methods. We believe that our experimental design, data, and troubleshooting would <b>aid future teams in the successful design of growth and survival assays</b> of <em>E. coli</em> expressing heat shock proteins, including and not limited to HSP22E.</p>
    <br /><br />

    <h4>Glutathione System</h4>
    <br />
    <p>We added two new basic parts to the registry page for two genes used in our glutathione system. These were GSHR1 (<b><a href="http://parts.igem.org/Part:BBa_K3750000" target="_blank">Part:BBa_K3750000</a></b>) and GPX5 (<b><a href="http://parts.igem.org/Part:BBa_K3750001" target="_blank">Part:BBa_K3750001</a></b>) from <em>Chlamydomonas reinhardtii</em>. Due to limited laboratory access resulting from COVID-19 restrictions, we could not add characterisation data but we believe that the <b>information learnt from literature that we documented on the respective Parts pages</b> would be useful for future teams. </p>
