It was also targeted at the general public in line with our goal of creating greater awareness for the benefits of synthetic biology. This event fostered a collaborative environment, allowing teams to gain insights into eachothers’ approach to iGEM, the problems being faced around the world, and the audiences’ take on the presented solutions. Other notable collaboration efforts include working with iGEM St Andrews through our Human Practices department, wherein meetings were held to discuss ideas and data as we had similar projects. We also collaborated with fellow Sydney-based team iGEM USyd consistently throughout the year, informing each other of laboratory progress and providing each other with wiki support.

                <p>A diversity of stakeholder opinions were vital in shaping our project to be deemed responsible and good for the world. A people-centered approach, with a focus on engaging with stakeholders through in depth interviews and email exchanges, ensured we understood the social and cultural implications of our project. Our four focus stakeholder groups were Academics, Traditional Owners, Businesses and Government Bodies. By first meeting with social scientists, we delved into the ethics and social values to ensure our project was informed ethically and our HP discussion was free of biases. The ensuing consultations with various individuals allowed us to deeply understand their perspective on coral bleaching and what constitutes a good solution in both application and post-care for our reefs. Ultimately, our project was inclusive of a broad set of values, including environmental, cultural, political and economic to produce a solution that the people will see as good and necessary.

            <td><p>Our Proposed Implementation details how we designed a three-step approach to implement our project into the environment. The approach involves ex-situ testing of our modified <em>Symbiodinium sp.</em> in a simulated reef environment, followed by in-situ testing of our modified algae in areas of depleted coral biodiversity. The final stage of our implementation is the in-situ release of our modified algal system into normal biodiversity conditions. As a team, we have elected our end-users to be the government and non-government organisations whose incentives are to conserve and protect the marine environment. Safety aspects we considered relate to preserving the biodiversity of the GBR and preventing unintentional invasion of our modified species outside of its intended environment. To mitigate this risk, we investigated kill switches to our designs to ensure that our algal symbiote remains controlled and will cease functioning once a threshold for increased coral biodiversity is reached.

The responses from our internationally-diverse survey allowed us to analyse the public’s perception of GMOs and their perspectives on our proposed solution. The feedback recapitulated the need to maintain transparency from our end, and we enacted this response by developing a pipeline detailing the future of our project and creating a comprehensive risk assessment that provides solutions to mitigate any foreseeable risks from the implementation of our product. These were informed by peer-reviewed journal articles and integrating the key takeaways of our consultations with a wide array of stakeholders. Although the latter provided an assorted outlook on the use of GMOs to solve this issue, each conversation reaffirmed the positive reception of our solution and its intended purpose.

            <td>Project Modeling</td>

            <td><p>Our team’s solution revolves around implementing transcribable proteins into the algal symbiont. For this, we modelled both parts of our solution - small heat shock proteins and a glutathione antioxidant system - to observe how the systems may behave in our target organism. Additionally, since our project addresses the incidence of increasing coral bleaching due to rising sea temperatures, we also had to consider how changes to temperature and pH levels in the ocean will affect our engineering approach. To study the small heat shock protein HSP22E, we performed extensive structural modelling to develop energetically and biologically favourable predictions for the monomeric and oligomeric structures of HSP22E, and used molecular dynamics to observe the protein’s interaction with denatured proteins. To gain insights into the glutathione system, we constructed a kinetic model to study the behaviour of the three part enzymatic system, using the observations to support and inform decisions surrounding the Wet Lab’s experimental design.

Additionally, to involve those who may be more interested in the design and aesthetic of science promotion, we’ve included plushies and felt pattern cutouts. For young adults, an educational board game was designed to depict the complexity of coral reef ecology and humanitarian impacts. Educational content was also included, directly targeting more mature individuals who wish to learn more about the basics of synthetic biology with details about what we have done in the scientific field. It was originally planned to have these packages physically, however, with ongoing COVID situations this became difficult. However, in the spirit of making science more accessible, we have pushed ourselves to render a completely online version.

                <p>The lack of community perspective and a diversity in voices has been a lacking field in scientific studies. Especially when these scientific issues are focused on tackling larger environmental issues, we tend to see a hyperfixation on the solution at hand with ill consideration on how the populace feels. Having seen this issue during the initial stages of our research, we wanted to incorporate a range of voices into our project. To do this, we reached out to artists in communities around the Great Barrier Reef, with specific focus on the Traditional Owners of the land. We wanted to ensure that our project was completely respectful of their cultural and spiritual values, whilst communicating this to an international audience through a Virtual Exhibition. This smaller effort would allow us to define our project goals as necessary by a larger majority of Australians instead of just the scientific community.

                <p>The two branches of our computational modelling served to guide our system design, informing changes or insights into the functionality of our solution. Structural modelling of our proposed heat shock protein served to investigate its mechanism of action and simulate its behaviour in a heat stressed environment. Models served to answer questions regarding the structural functionality and binding of aggregate proteins to our enzyme under heat stress. Kinetic modelling of our proposed glutathione system provided insights into how we might synthetically modify the system while still maintaining viable cell homeostasis. We ascertained how the balance of reactive oxygen species and reduced glutathione concentration could affect our target host. Modelling the antioxidant capability of the system with varying levels of glutathione helped us to determine which proteins, enzymes or macromolecules could or should be introduced to increase redox activity without damaging the cell.

                <p>The growing communication gap between the public and science has led to a general mistrust in the scientific belief system. This year, the team has made an active effort to incorporate the opinions of a range of stakeholders from government, to businesses, academics and the wider community. We devised a publicly available survey to help us analyse the perception of synthetic biology with reference to our proposed solution. With the feedback provided we’ve developed a pipeline detailing the future of our project, creating a comprehensive risk assessment of foreseeable risks, in line with multiple propositions that science needs to be more transparent to the public. We’ve also incorporated the perspectives of our stakeholders, especially academics and the Indigenous community, to inform scientific project design and the communication of our project to the public to generate a holistic solution that is reflective of an Australian effort to reduce coral bleaching.

                <p>Our team explored different ways to communicate the purpose of synthetic biology and our solution to different age groups. We created a storybook for children to learn scientific methodology and its application to real world issues. For young adults, an educational board game was designed, aimed at helping them consider the complexity of coral reefs yet their sensitivity to changes like pollution. We considered those interested in the aesthetic design of our solution, including plushies and felt pattern cutouts. We also included educational content to communicate more about synthetic biology with details about our team’s efforts in the scientific field. The purpose of appealing to a diverse range of demographics was to communicate the importance of synthetic biology and reduce stigmatisation around it. We also aimed to make our audiences consider and be aware of how sensitive an ecosystem the coral reef is, with thoughts focused on greater conservational efforts.

                <p>A major problem we identified throughout the project was the under-representation of communal perspectives. In our opinion, a good solution should serve to solve a problem AND be complemented by public perception. We released a survey to understand public and global perception, with responses indicating a lack of understanding of the cultural significance of the Great Barrier Reef to Australians and their identity. To overcome this, we sought to incorporate communal voices, especially Indigenous communities, into the project by creating a virtual exhibit of local Australian artists. This served as a platform for Australians to communicate the cultural significance of the Great Barrier Reef to their identity. Feedback indicated the inspiration our audiences felt in learning about the livelihood and experiences of our local artists. This only motivated us further to create a project that was receptive by the public whilst encouraging others to consider local communities.
